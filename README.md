# StyledText

Text widget with formatted text using tags. Makes it easier to use formatted text in multilingual applications.

Formatting is set in the text using **xml tags**, for which styles are defined separately. It is also possible to insert icons through tags for which icons are set in styles.

You can set the click handler for the tag, through a special style ActionTextStyle.
